Libsodium is a modern cryptography library that offers authenticated encryption, high-speed elliptic curve cryptography, and much more. Unlike other cryptography standards (which are a potluck of cryptography primitives; i.e. WebCrypto), libsodium is comprised of carefully selected algorithms implemented by security experts to avoid side-channel vulnerabilities.
